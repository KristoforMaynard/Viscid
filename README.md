This repository will start at Viscid version 0.95.0. For previous versions,
clone from `fishercat.sr.unh.edu:~kmaynard/git/ViscidLegacy.git`

The reson for this loss of history is that the sample data files used for
the tests were needlessly large, especially now that the travis-ci tests
make multiple clones on each push.
