# IMPORTANT: py3k mayavi depends on vtk 7, which completely revamps the
#            OpenGL backend. As a result, many versions of MESA are inadequate.
#            It seems VTK 7 needs at least MESA version 11.2. The following
#            might help, but I have yet to find a machine where they do...
#              > export MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=3.2
#              > export MESA_GLSL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=150
# platform: osx-64 linux-64 win-64
